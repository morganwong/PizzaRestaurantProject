Version 0.0.2;

Added homepage, added css and js folders.
    - No need to use app.js, just added as placeholder.

Added header and footer that we can reuse for each page

Added 'Order' modal, like header and footer, should be included in each page.

When updating JS, doesn't seem to be updating on the github pages site.
This is due to caching, not updating to newer js file. crtl + f5 on chrome to clear site cache

git clone first
'git pull origin master' to pull down any updates in repo
do git pull before a push to make sure your code is up to date
